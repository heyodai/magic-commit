Refactor `sanitize_csv_file()` for Enhanced Encoding Support

In an effort to augment the robustness of the `sanitize_csv_file()` function within our data sanitization pipeline, a refactor has been conducted to incorporate a sequential encoding detection mechanism. Initially, the function now attempts to interpret CSV files using UTF-8 encoding; should this endeavor fail due to a UnicodeDecodeError, a fallback to ISO-8859-1 encoding is engaged. This modification not only mitigates the risk of encountering character encoding issues during the file reading process but also enhances the function's versatility in accommodating files of varied origins. Furthermore, the inclusion of a comprehensive logging strategy ensures that any failures in reading the file with the specified encodings are dutifully recorded, thereby facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.

Extend Integer Conversion Check to Include `RoofShape` in Data Sanitization Process

In the latest commit, the data sanitization script's capability has been expanded through the inclusion of the 'RoofShape' column in the integer conversion validation process. This update is part of an ongoing effort to refine our data integrity checks and is a precursor to a broader implementation intended for the Commercial Residential (CR) dataset. By incorporating 'RoofShape' into the array of columns designated for conversion to integers, we ensure a more comprehensive data cleaning operation, thereby bolstering the accuracy of our analytical outcomes. This step marks a significant stride towards our objective of achieving a uniform and error-resistant data framework.

Optimize Excel Workbook Merge to Exclude Repeated Headers

The workbook merging script has been meticulously revised to introduce a novel functionality: the exclusion of repetitive header rows from subsequent Excel files in the consolidation process. This optimization was achieved by incorporating an iterative enumeration over the collection of workbooks, paired with a conditional check that identifies and skips the header row after the initial workbook has been processed. The adjustment guarantees that the final merged workbook is devoid of redundant header information, thereby enhancing data integrity and reducing the necessity for post-processing rectification. The change signifies a critical improvement in the script's operational efficiency and output quality.
